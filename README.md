# Tail Wise AI

The aim of the project is to build a dog breed detection and behaviour monitoring system utilising deep  learning  and  transfer  learning  approaches.  The  research  focuses  on  using  artificial intelligence to accurately identify dog breeds and track behaviour. The project achieves high accuracy rates of 97% and 83%, respectively, by the adoption of specialised models, such as CNN Xception for breed identification and ResNet-18 with fastai for emotion analysis. The yolov7 model is used to detect objects. The combination of these models provides a thorough framework for analysing and tracking canine behaviour, which is helpful in fields like training, research, and animal welfare as well as veterinary care.  
Using the xception CNN model, the developed system predicts 80 dog breeds with an amazing 97% accuracy. Because of its robustness, it can be used in real-world scenarios including pet care, behaviour  analysis,  and  security.  Four  dog  emotions  (happy,  sad,  angry  and  relaxed)  are recognised  by  the  system,  and  dog  and  object  identification  is  made  possible  via  yolov7 integration. Automatic email notifications are sent when a hazardous object is detected to protect dogs by the users. Due to resource constraints, video analysis has replaced real-time monitoring; however, the technology is still flexible and provides accurate breed recognition and behaviour tracking  in  a  variety  of  contexts.  The  project  advances  scientific  knowledge,  human-dog interactions,  and  responsible  pet  ownership  by  precisely  classifying  breeds  and  examining behaviours.
